🎯 Objective

Learn to combine and retrieve data from multiple tables using different types of SQL JOIN operations.
🧰 Tools Used

    DB Browser for SQLite / MySQL Workbench

🛠️ Features / What I Did

    Created two related tables:

        Customers

        Orders

    Practiced the following join types:

        ✅ INNER JOIN – Fetched customers who placed orders.

        ✅ LEFT JOIN – Listed all customers, including those with no orders.

        ✅ RIGHT JOIN – Listed all orders, including those without customer details (if any).

        ✅ FULL OUTER JOIN – Combined both LEFT and RIGHT JOIN results (using UNION in MySQL).

        ✅ CROSS JOIN – Displayed all possible customer-order combinations.

        ✅ Self JOIN – Found customers from the same city.
